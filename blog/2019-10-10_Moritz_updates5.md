# Trality updates #5

### The Rule Builder!

Great news: today we are launching another puzzle piece in our mission of bringing algorithmic trading to the people: the Trality Rule Builder. This part of our Bot Creator lets you develop powerful Trading Bots without the need for code. Check it out! ✌️

## Why use the Trality Rule Builder?

-   Build upon curated, pre-defined trading strategies
-   Select from over 100 technical indicators
-   Use boolean logic to arrange strategy parts
-   Backtest your strategy with historical data
-   Evolve from builder to coder by transforming rule-based bots into code-based ones (coming soon!)
