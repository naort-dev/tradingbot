# Trality updates #2

### Bot Creator Beta is now online!

Yes, it’s been a while since you heard from us, but we’ve been busy building an awesome product. So today, we can finally announce the launch of the Trality Bot Creator Beta ­– a version with the key tools you need to code and deploy high-performing trading bots.

Let’s fill you in on the details! ✌️

## This Beta version is perfect for…

…people who really love to dive deep into algorithms and want to code amazing trading bots: quants, mathematicians, statisticians or people who generally love quantitative problem solving. To all of you we say: try our Beta! To all non-coders we say: check out the outlook section below, soon we will release features which let you profit from bots without the need a single line of code! **[Join our Beta!](https://auth.beta.trality.com/#/signup)**

## Key feature: the code-based Trality Bot Creator

-The Code-based Trality Bot Creator is the heart of this Beta: it’s a completely cloud-based bot editor including a custom Python API, over 100 technical indicators as well as a blazingly fast back-testing feature.
-Paper-trading: initially, we offer the possibility to paper-trade on virtual accounts. This decision was made in an effort to maximize reliability and safety before rolling out live-trading in the very near future.
-Trality Bot Dashboard: it lets you monitor and analyze the current progress of our active trading bots in every detail and gives you an overview over your complete portfolio.

This Beta is mainly targeted towards coders. But in the future, the Trality user base consists of two different groups: those who create and those who follow trading bots. The next months are dedicated to building the most advanced platform for users, who want to follow bots. This finally lets all of you experience the excitement of algorithmic trading without the need to write a single line of code!
