                            Up until now, algorithmic crypto trading was reserved for a handful of expert traders. 
                            Trality finally lets leisure traders who have limited experience with algorithmic trading make use of trading bots to continuously beat the crypto market for profits. Itâ€™s simple: experts design the most complex bots
                            and everyone can follow their trade signals without investing much time and know-how.
